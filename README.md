# AsciiArtAnimation
Animates ascii art from a text file

# Instructions
The first line of the text file must contain the number of lines per "page" or "frame." This includes any blank lines separating each page/frame. See datboi.txt for an example :)

To run it, use the following command:

```./ascii_anim.sh datboi.txt```

To run the animation "forever" aka to repeat it use "r" as the second argument:

```./ascii_anim.sh datboi.txt r```

To quit the animation early, press "q" or CTRL-C
